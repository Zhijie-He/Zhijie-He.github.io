	The growing need of responsiveness for enterprises
facing market volatility raises a strong demand for flexibility in 
their human resource management. This paper presents a multi-objective model for Multi-skill Project Scheduling Problem. 
We propose a new wage distribution method in which different
perform efficiencies of human resources are taken into account.
The model aims at minimizing project duration and project costs 
concurrently. An improved NSGA-II algorithm is designed to 
solve the model. The algorithm introduces a multi-dimensional 
chromosome coding scheme to identify the priorities and staff 
allocation of each activity. Special chromosome crossover and 
mutation operation are employed to address resource conflicts
and constraint violations. Eventually, A case study is presented to 
verify the efficiency of the proposed approach.
